# New York Times Wordle API data downloader

This script downloads the stored Wordle data (with the user's play history and details from their last game) from the NYTimes server. You need a nytimes.com login, but a free one will do; you don't need a subscription.

Run with:

./dl_wordle_data.sh <nyt username> <nyt password>
